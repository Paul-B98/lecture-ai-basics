It emphasises simplicity, readability, and clarity. These principles encourage developers to write clean, understandable, and maintainable code rather than overly clever or complicated solutions. You can view the full Zen by running import this in a Python interpreter, reminding yourself of these best practices whenever writing Python code for data analysis, AI, or general software development."

    "Python is a versatile, high-level programming language widely used in data analysis, AI, and software development. It has evolved significantly since its first official release, Python 1.0 in 1994, which established its core features. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. The last version of the Python 2.x series, was Python 2.7 with a end of life support until January 1, 2020. Python 3.0, released in December 2008, which brought backward-incompatible changes to improve consistency, such as treating print as a function and supporting Unicode by default. The current version of Python is 3.13 released in 2024.\n",
