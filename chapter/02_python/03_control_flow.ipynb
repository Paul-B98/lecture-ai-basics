    "Python uses [conditional statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements) to control the flow of a program based on specific conditions. The `if` statement checks a condition and runs a block of code if it's true. The `elif` (short for `“else if”`) allows you to test multiple conditions in sequence if the first if is false. Finally, `else` provides a fallback block of code that runs when none of the previous conditions are met. This structure helps Python make decisions step by step, from top to bottom. How this works is shown in the example below:"
